DISABLE UNAVAILABLE VARIATION

what i need for my data: sku variation options
what will i do with that data: check if those variation options combo for the sku is = 0

COMPARE with

what i need for my data: selected variation option (loop it and go over it in case there are more than 2 options)
what else do i need: the variation option that is being checked at the moment
what will i do: combine all 3 and find the matching variation options from above and check if stock is 0

if stock is 0, DISABLE



PROBLEMS:

- initial variations that don't exist at all are not blocked





FOR STOCK QUANTITY SELECTOR:


what i need to do: disable stock quantity until the variation options selected have the same length as variation groups
once variation is picked and saved, we need to get the SKU with the product id and variation options, then thats when we can determine the stock
quantity limit you can add.

what should be created: a helper function that disables the selector if variation options is < 0.
